# aa-channels-lib

This library handles a bidirectionnal payment channel based on [Autonomous Agents](https://medium.com/obyte/introducing-autonomous-agents-6fe12fb12aa3)
It allows free, instant and confirmation-free offchain transactions between two parties.
Example of use cases: pay-per-call API, pay-per-time streaming...

## How does it work?

The library can either be included in a Node.js project or as a stand-alone Node.js program controlled with Remote-Procedure-Call (RPC).
Both parties willing to transact have to use the library.
The library runs an [headless-wallet](https://github.com/byteball/headless-obyte) that has to be funded prior to operation.

The communication between peers can be handled by the library, in this case two choices are available:
- Encrypted chat: virtually no setup but has some latency, is not adapted for consequent volume of data and is hub-dependent.
- HTTPS: a party that wants to receive payment has to setup an Nginx proxy but the communication is direct, very fast and the application can be infinitely scalable (see High Availability node)

The communication can be external, all you need is a mean to transfer a payment package in JSON. The payment package is obtained with `createPaymentPackage` function and can be verified by receveir with `verifyPaymentPackage`.

## Basic example
One peer initiates the creation with:
```javascript
channels.createNewChannel(peer, initial_amount, options, function(error, aa_address, unit){

});
```
**peer** is an url or a pairing address, **aa_address** is returned by the function and is to be saved as it will used to identify channel for further operation.
Transactions can begin immediately if peer accepts unconfirmed payments or after confirmation by the network

One peer wanting to send an offchain payment uses this function:

```javascript
channels.sendMessageAndPay(aa_address, message_to_peer, amount, function(error, response){
	if (error)
		return console.log(error);
	else
		return console.log(response);
});
```
**aa_address** is the address of the channel provided during its creation, **message_to_peer** is anything that can be parsed in JSON (string, number or object) and that you want to transmit to your peer, **amount** is the amount of your payment and **function** is a callback that will be returned with **error** or **response** from your peer.

You can set a function to be executed when you receive an offchain payment:
```javascript
channels.setCallBackForPaymentReceived(function(amount, asset, message, peer_address, handle){
	if (message == "thanks me")
		return handle(null, "Thank you " + peer_address + " I received you payment of " + amount + " " + asset);
	else if (message == "send me an error")
		return handle("this is an error");
});

```
The response can be a number, a string or an object, and will be forwarded to the payer.


The channel can be closed an anytime by one of the party with:
```javascript
channels.close(aa_address, function(error){
	if (error)
		console.error(error);
});
```
After confirmation by peer or a timeout, you headless wallet will receive a payment calculated as follow:
**amount received** = **total amount deposited by you to the channel** - **total amount paid to your peer** + **total payment received from your peer**

All functions and events available are documented there: https://github.com/Papabyte/aa-channels-lib/blob/master/doc/reference.md

## Configuration
Depending on your needs, different configurations are possible.

#### Vendor configuration

#### Client configuration

<details><summary>Include module in your node.js project</summary>

* Add the package to your project:
`npm install --save https://github.com/Papabyte/aa-channels-lib.git`

* Require the module at the beginning of your code.
`const channels = require('aa-channels-lib')`

For events you need also
`const eventBus = require('ocore/event_bus.js')`

All library [functions](doc/reference.md#Functions) are available as property, example:
```javascript
channels.setAutoRefill("7FLNK5AIWSYU2TVEKRW4CHCQUAKOYGWG",122000, 300000, function(error){
	if (error)
		console.log(error);
});
```

All [events](doc/reference.md#Events) can be subscribed with `eventBus.on(event,function(){})`, example: 

```javascript
eventBus.on("channel_created_by_peer", function(peer_address, aa_address){ 
	console.log("a peer created a channel, aa address: " + aa_address + ", peer address: " + peer_address)
});
```
</details>

<details><summary>Run as RPC server</summary>

* Install Node.js > version 6
* clone the library 
`git clone https://github.com/Papabyte/aa-channels-lib.git `
* Run Rpcify
`cd aa-channels-lib`
`node rpcify.js`

By default port 6333 is accessible through HTTP or websocket, websocket is mandatory if you want to receive events.
Commands be send in JSON by POST method in http or websocket message, example: 
`curl --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0", "id":1, "method":"setAutoRefill", "params":["7FLNK5AIWSYU2TVEKRW4CHCQUAKOYGWG",122000, 300000]}'`

`method` is the name of the function you want to use, `params` is an array containing parameters you want to pass.

All functions and events are available (except `setCallBackForPaymentReceived` function).

<details><summary>Integrated communication</summary>

* Set in `enabledReceivers` array as below in your conf.js file as below:
```javascript
exports.enabledReceivers = ['http','obyte-messenger'];
```
* For HTTP, configure port:
```javascript
exports.httpDefaultPort = 6800;
```
</details>

<details><summary>External communication</summary>

* Leave `enabledReceivers` array empty in your conf.js file as below:
```javascript
exports.enabledReceivers = [];
```
Create channel with `createNewChannel` using peer's payment address as first parameter, obtain payment packages with `createPaymentPackage` and verify them with `verifyPaymentPackage`.
</details>

<details><summary>High Avaibility mode</summary>

A node only destinated to receive payment can run in high-availability mode. In this case, the front service that handles the requests from clients is separated from a background service that runs the headless wallet. Several front services can run in parallel to serve clients even when the background goes down for some time (like for being updated). That greatly helps the scalability of your business.

The exact setup depends of you need but you will likely use:
* a load balancer that will redirect https requests to different front service instances.
* an external MySQL database to which front app and background app can connect to.

Check specific documentation there: https://github.com/Papabyte/aa-channels-lib/blob/master/doc/ha_mode.md

<details><summary>Web dashboard</summary>
A local web dashboard can be enabled to check the states of all channels 

* Port configuration:
```javascript
exports.webServerPort = 8080;
```
